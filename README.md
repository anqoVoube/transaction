# Configuration

This is a simple Python project to transfer tokens in the Mumbai Polygon test network.

## Getting Started

Here's how to set up the project:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anqoVoube/transaction.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd transaction
```


### 2. Set up .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project directory and set your private key for the Mumbai Polygon test network. Your `.env` file should look something like this:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyHere
```


Please make sure to replace `YourPrivateKeyHere` with your actual private key.
> **NOTE:** You don't need quotation marks in your variable's value.
> 
**IMPORTANT:** Never share your private key with anyone. If someone gets access to your private key, they can steal all your funds. Always keep it secret!

### 3. Run the main.py script

Finally, run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python3 main.py
```


And that's it! Your project is now set up and ready to go.
